# Materialize ref/team-skills/ld-shared from the canonical shared repo
# (plow-pbc/life-dashboard-skills). ld-shared is NOT vendored in this seed —
# it is gitignored. It is the shared contract layer BOTH life-dashboard agent
# seeds pull (the kiosk-POST helper + the wire/tile protocol + the ld-config
# template), so a fix lands once upstream instead of being hand-applied to two
# repos. This seed owns only its six platform-specific producers.
#
# Idempotent: re-running refreshes the pinned ref. Overridable for dev/CI:
#   LD_SKILLS_REPO  — clone source (default: the public GitHub repo)
#   LD_SKILLS_REF   — branch or tag to pull (default: main)
