"""Wrapper-contract test for this seed's ld- producers.

The shared POST helper (post_to_kiosk.py) and its own tests live in
plow-pbc/life-dashboard-skills, pulled in as ld-shared by ref/sync-ld-shared.sh
(run this AFTER that sync). This test verifies the part that lives in THIS seed:
each producer's thin wrapper sets the right CARD / BODY_TYPE on the shared
module at import, per the pinned producer→card mapping the viewer renders
(1=alert, 2=affirmation, 3=weather, 4=digest, 5=sports). On Hermes every
producer — including weather and sports — runs as an LLM cron job that calls a
Python wrapper, so all six are listed.

Each wrapper runs in a fresh interpreter: an in-process import would find
post_to_kiosk already in sys.modules and mask a broken relative sys.path in the
wrapper. A subprocess makes the wrapper's import path actually load-bearing.
